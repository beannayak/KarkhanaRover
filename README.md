1. Load the current stable version (Karkhana Rover Stable - Aruduino) on to an Aruduino.
2. Make sure assumptions on pins used for sensor control, motor control match deployed platform. See Karkhana Rover
Circuit Digaram,
3. Download VB GUI
4. You do NOT have to choose a com port. The application does this automatically.

Future Improvements
====================
1. Python Based GUI
2. Share robot shield design
3. Simply wires and sensors on robot
