1. Load the current stable version (Karkhana Rover Stable - Aruduino) on to an Aruduino.
2. Make sure assumptions on pins used for sensor control, motor control match deployed platform. See Karkhana Rover
Circuit Digaram,
3. Download VB GUI (mars oddessy GUI visualbasic .net) Executable file is in 'mars oddessy/bin/debug'
4. You do NOT have to choose a com port. The application does this automatically.

Future Improvements
====================
1. Python Based GUI.
2. Share robot Printed Circuit Board's wire(shield) layout.
3. Simple wires and sensors on robot.
